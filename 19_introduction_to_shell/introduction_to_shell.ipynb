    "An operating system like Windows, Linux, or Mac OS is a special kind of program. It controls the computer's processor, hard drive, and network connection, but its most important job is to run other programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since human beings aren't digital, they need an interface to interact with the operating system. The most common one these days is a graphical file explorer, which translates clicks and double-clicks into commands to open files and run programs. Before computers had graphical displays, though, people typed instructions into a program called a **command-line shell**. Each time a command is entered, the shell runs some other programs, prints their output in human-readable form, and then displays a *prompt* to signal that it's ready to accept the next command. (Its name comes from the notion that it's the \"outer shell\" of the computer.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Typing commands instead of clicking and dragging may seem clumsy at first, but as you will see, once you start spelling out what you want the computer to do, you can combine old commands to create new ones and automate repetitive operations with just a few keystrokes.\n",

If you are in `/home/repl/seasonal`, then `cd ..` moves you up to `/home/repl`. If you use `cd ..` once again, it puts you in `/home`.

    "### How can I select lines containing specific values?\n",
    "\n",
    "`head` and `tail` select rows, `cut` selects columns, and `grep` selects lines according to what they contain. In its simplest form, `grep` takes a piece of text followed by one or more filenames and prints all of the lines in those files that contain that text. For example, `grep bicuspid seasonal/winter.csv` prints lines from `winter.csv` that contain \"bicuspid\".\n",
    "\n",
    "`grep` can search for patterns as well; we will explore those in the next course. What's more important right now is some of `grep`'s more common flags:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `-c`: print a count of matching lines rather than the lines themselves\n",
    "- `-h`: do not print the names of files when searching multiple files\n",
    "- `-i`: ignore case (e.g., treat \"Regression\" and \"regression\" as matches)\n",
    "- `-l`: print the names of files that contain matches, not the matches\n",
    "- `-n`: print line numbers for matching lines\n",
    "- `-v`: invert the match, i.e., only show lines that don't match\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Print the contents of all of the lines containing the word `molar` in `seasonal/autumn.csv` by running a single command while in your home directory. Don't use any flags.\n",
    "2. Invert the match to find all of the lines that *don't* contain the word `molar` in `seasonal/spring.csv`, and show their line numbers. Remember, it's considered good style to put all of the flags *before* other values like filenames or the search term \"molar\".\n",
    "3. Count how many lines contain the word `incisor` in `autumn.csv` and `winter.csv` combined. (Again, run a single command from your home directory.)"

    "3. Run `date-range.sh` on all four of the seasonal data files using `seasonal/*.csv` to match their names, and pipe its output to `sort` to see that your scripts can be used just like Unix's built-in commands."
